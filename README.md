# Object Oriented Programming Challenge
For this challenge, a bank account class should have two attributes:
* owner
* balance

and two methods:
* deposit
* withdraw

As an added requirement, withdrawals may not exceed the available balance.
Instantiate your class, make several deposits and withdrawals, and test to make sure the account can't be overdrawn.
